Chromosome Analysis Working Model

Early detection of fetal chromosomal disorders using karyotype analysis

Problem Statement
Chromosomal disorders in a fetus are usually detected through manual karyotyping, which is time-consuming and may involve human error. Delay in diagnosis can affect early medical decision-making and counseling.

Solution
This project presents a computer-based chromosome analysis model that uses image processing techniques to analyze karyotype chromosome images.
By digitizing the analysis process, the model supports faster and more accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities.

 Project Objective
To analyze karyotype chromosome images digitally
To detect numerical chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy
To support early diagnosis of fetal chromosomal disorders

Methodology 
Chromosome images are collected from a karyotype database
Images are processed using OpenCV (Python library)
Chromosomes are visually analyzed and compared with normal karyotype patterns
Abnormalities such as extra or missing chromosomes are identified
Results are displayed through a web-based interface

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Karyotype chromosome image database

Why Karyotype Database?
Provides standard and validated chromosome images
Helps in comparing normal vs abnormal karyotypes
Reduces manual interpretation errors


Applications
Early prenatal screening
Clinical cytogenetics support
Medical education and training
Research and academic demonstrations

Future Scope
Integration with real-time microscope images
Automated chromosome counting using AI
Support for structural chromosomal abnormalities
Clinical validation and hospital deployment
